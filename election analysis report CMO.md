# **Election Analysis**

## **Overview/Purpose**
	
	The purpose of this analysis is to determine the winner of the election, the total number of voters, the total voters per county,
as well as provide percentages and total votes for each candidate.

### **Analysis:**

	#### Election Results:

	This election spanned three countys. Those being Arapahoe, Jefferson and Denver. The total # of votes for this election came to 369,711
votes or voters. There were also only three candidates involved: Diana Degette, Charles Casper Stockham and Raymon Anthony Doane. It is not known
where each of the candidates originates from.

	The overall winner of the election was Diana Degette. She had a total vote count of 272,892 or 73.8% of all the votes.
The next largest vote count was for Charles Casper Stockham who had 85,213 votes or 23%. The least amount of votes went to 
Raymon Anthony Doane who had 11,606 votes or 3.1%

	There were three countys involved in the election. Arapahoe, Jefferson and Denver. The total votes as we know from above was 369,711.
Araphone had 6.7% of the votes totalling 24,801. Jefferson had 10.5% or 38,855 total votes. The county with the largest votes was Denver 
with 82.8% or 306,055 total votes.

	
### **Summary**

	This analysis can be modified to suit several different types of elections or any analysis that requires "votes". One example of this
would be voting on a bylaw for a region, county or city. Another could be for those positions within a government that requires individuals to
select or choose whom they believe would do the best job. The analysis of course would need to be modified to include the varying parameters such
as location or position depending on the overall purpose.

	As the analyses currently does not have a limit to the number of candidates or locations it can be quite useful with larger election 
sizes or areas such as a State vs County. In a State vote scenario the code could also be modified to get data from multiple locations/files.
